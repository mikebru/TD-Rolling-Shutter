# TD-Rolling-Shutter


This effect works in Touchdesigner by blending different times of a video together with any greyscale image or ramp. It is useful for creating transitions over time for video effects. It is also fun to use with a webcam to create interesting distortions. 

The Tox folder contains two similair effects. Rolling shutter works with video frames, while Collate Composite takes in a folder of images and composites those together.
